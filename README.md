Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (stock-price-prediction-1-.ipynb) that demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict stock prices. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Features
Data Collection: The notebook retrieves historical stock price data from a specified source.
Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values and normalizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand trends and patterns in the stock price data.
Model Selection: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to predict future stock prices.
Model Evaluation: Metrics used to evaluate model performance, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared values.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and any other dependencies used in the notebook.
